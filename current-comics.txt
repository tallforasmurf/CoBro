# A comic file is a UTF-8 text file (because some comic names have non-Latin-1 characters).
# In it, each comic is defined on a single line by two quoted strings.
# The first string is the comic name. The second string is its URL.
# Example: 'Bug Comic', 'http://www.bugcomic.com'
# The strings are delimited by 'single' or "double" quotes or «guillemets»,
# and separated by spaces and/or commas. Any lines that do NOT match
# that format are ignored, and can be used as commentary, like these lines.
