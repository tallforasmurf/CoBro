# A comic file is a latin-1 (ISO-8892-1) or ASCII file. In it, each
# comic is defined on a single line by two quoted strings.
# The first string is the comic name. The second string is its URL.
# Example: 'Bug Comic', 'http://www.bugcomic.com'
# The strings are delimited by 'single' or "double" quotes (sorry no guillemets)
# and separated by spaces and/or commas. All lines that don't match
# that format are ignored, and can be used as commentary, like these lines.

* the following are usually suitable for sub-teen readers. 
* several, e.g. Agnes, Stone Soup, are major comics with newspaper distribution
