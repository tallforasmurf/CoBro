# A comic file is a latin-1 (ISO-8892-1) or ASCII file. In it, each
# comic is defined on a single line by two or three quoted strings.
# The first string is the comic name. The second string is its URL.
# The optional third string is exactly seven letters long and stands for the days
# of the week Monday to Sunday. A hyphen means "no update" and a non-hyphen
# means "updates this day" so: 'Bug Comic', 'http://www.bugcomic.com', 'MTWTF--'
# When the third string is omitted the default is "test for update every day".
# The strings are delimited by 'single' or "double" quotes (sorry no guillemets)
# and separated by spaces and/or commas. All lines that don't match are ignored
# and can be used as commentary, like these lines.

* the following are always suitable for sub-teen readers. 
* several, e.g. Agnes, Stone Soup, are major comics with newspaper distribution
