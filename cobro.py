CoBro (Comic Browser) is a minimal web browser designed for convenient
reading of Web Comics. The main window has a list of comic names on the left
and a web page display on the right.

Associated with each comic in the list are these persistent items:

  * the user-selected name

  * the user-provided URL of the comic

  * an SHA-1 hash based on the contents of the page at the URL, as it
    was when the comic was last displayed to the user

These three items are saved in the app Settings at shutdown and reloaded at startup.

Three other items are associated with each comic, but are created dynamically
as the program runs:

  * the contents of the page at the comic URL

  * an SHA-1 hash based on the contents of the page at the URL, as it
    was when read most recently.

  * a status, one of:

     - NEWCOMIC: comic has not been displayed since it was read,
       i.e., the saved hash is not equal to the new hash.

     - OLDCOMIC: comic has been read and displayed to the user,
       i.e. the saved and latest hash values are the same

     - WORKING: comic page is being read from its URL.

     - BADCOMIC: error on http request or load, no data

All these data are maintained in memory as a list of Comic objects. The list
is displayed to the user using the Qt model/view classes: The model is the
Python list of Comic objects; a QListView derivative displays the list.

The comic names in the list are shown in different fonts to reflect the
status: normal for OLDCOMIC, bold for NEWCOMIC, italic for WORKING
and strikeout for BADCOMIC.

When the user clicks on a comic in the list, the text of that comic's page,
as last read, is loaded into the web page display with setHTML(), where it
is rendered. The displayed page can be used as in any browser, e.g. the
user can click on buttons and follow links in the page. See the class
CobroWebPage for details of browser initialization and options.

The list supports the following operations:

  * single-click an item to select and display that comic in the web display

  * drag and drop selected items to reorder the list

  * double-click an item to open an Edit Comic dialog which permits
        editing the name and URL.

There is a single menu, the File menu, with these commands:

  * New Comic
        opens a dialog to collect the name and URL of a new comic,
        which is added to the list at the bottom.

  * Refresh
        Apply refresh to the comics selected in the list if any, or to
        all if no selection. The refresh operation is described below.

  * Delete
        After querying for OK, delete the selected comics (if any).

  * Quit
        Save the persistent comic values in QSettings and terminate.

  * Export
        Present a file-save dialog to choose a filename and destination.
        Export a text file containing the names and URLs of all
        selected comics, or all comics when none are selected.

  * Import
        Present a file-open dialog to choose a text file. Read the file
        and add any comics defined in it, based on the format written
        by the Export command. If a comic of the same name exists in
        the list already, it is replaced.

Refresh operation:

When the app loads, or when File>Refresh is chosen, or when the URL of a
comic is edited, the app pushes the model index of all, or selected, or the
edited Comic onto a queue and triggers a QSemaphore. A separate QThread waits
on the semaphore. While there is work on the queue this thread:

* pops the next model index qmi from the queue and:

* signals statusChanged(qmi, WORKING),

* initiates a page-load from the item's URL, saving the text
  in the Comic object,

* if the load ends in error it signals statusChanged(qmi, BADCOMIC)

* else it computes the hash based on the loaded page and saves it
  in the Comic object as new_hash.

* if the new_hash is the same as the saved hash, it signals
  statusChanged(qmi, OLDCOMIC)

* else the new hash is different, the user hasn't seen this comic, so
  it signals statusChanged(qmi, NEWCOMIC)

The statusChanged signal goes to a slot in the list model which updates the
status of the item and calls dataChanged(), with the result that the list
view will call data() for new display data -- resulting in a change of font
in the displayed name of the comic.

In this way, shortly after launching, the user has a list of comics ready
to be read, with the ones not yet read, in bold.

<p>That's enough! There are <i>thousands</i> of web comics out there!
The ones above are of the daily-joke variety, but there comics at
every level of style and subject up to the
richly-drawn graphic novels like <a href='http://www.sssscomic.com/'>Stand Still Stay Silent</a>
or <a href='http://girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php'>Girl Genius</a>.
For U.S. syndicated (newspaper) cartoons, try
<a href='http://comics.com/'>Comics.com</a>, or check the website of your
regional newspaper under "Entertainment". For independent comics,
<a href='https://www.comic-rocket.com/'>The Comic Rocket</a> and
<a href='http://new.belfrycomics.net/'>The Belfry</a>
are searchable indexes of hundreds of comics.</p>
<p>To "refresh" a comic means to read its web page and see if it is
different from the last time. All comics are refreshed when the app starts!</p>
<ul><li>While we are reading its page, a comic's name is <i>italic</i>.</li>
<li>After reading, if the comic looks different from the last time you viewed it,
its name turns <b>bold</b>. (Sometimes this only means a change in
ad copy, blog post, or user comments.)</li>
<li>If there was a problem reading it, its name is <strike>lined-out</strike>.
Click on it to see the error message.</li>
<li>If a comic always appears old and you know it has been updated, then probably
its server has sussed us out as a robot of some kind. Alas, Ninja and Pirate thinks
we are a web-scraper and always serves the same "I'm not a robot" page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use File&gt;Refresh to refresh a new or edited comic, or to retry one with an error.
When all refreshes are finished, you can rearrange the list order
by dragging the names. Double-click a comic in the list
to edit its name and URL.</p>
<p>While browsing, control-click or right-click on this window for a
context menu for navigating back or copying a link.</p>
<p>When you quit the app, it saves the list of
comic definitions in some magic settings place
(Windows: Registry, Mac: Library/Preferences, Linux: ~/.config).</p>
<p>Use File&gt;Export to write definitions of the selected comics to a UTF-8 text file.
Use File&gt;Import to read definitions from a file and add them to the list
(or to replace them, when the name's the same). To learn the import file format,
export one comic and look at that output!</p>
<p>The list font is of course <a href='http://www.sheldoncomics.com/archive/070511.html'>Comic Sans</a>.
That's it! Enjoy! Oh wait -- read the license!</p>

# URL blacklist is not a perfect solution -- is the comic
# romanticallyapocalyptic.com, which loads dozens of things from
# subdirectories, .../imgs or .../flags or .../badges, and not in the same
# order each time. Because order matters when composing a hash, the same
# things loaded in different order will make a mismatched hash. One way
# to fix this comic would be to ignore all img tags except for one from the
# subdirectory .../art/..., but this would require a positive test, not a negative
# filter, and a regex at that. Alternatively change the whole hashing process

# This is how we make a hash signature of a comic web page. Instead of
# hashing the whole HTML text of the page, we only hash the src='' values
# of the <img statements in it, assuming that these should not change
# from day to day except for the one img that is the day's comic.
#
# MyParser is an HTML parser subclass. A new parser object is created for
# each Comic object that is read. The __init__ receives a new sha1 hasher
# object to use and a flag indicating if the hash process is to be logged.
#
# The parser is applied to the text read from a comic's page. The parser
# calls the method handle_starttag() for every tag it finds. In that method,
# all start tags except <img are ignored. The src= attribute of each <img is
# pushed into the hasher. Thus the hash is built on image urls only. The idea
# is that when this hash is the same as the prior time the comic was read,
# the comic has not changed. When the hash is different, the comic is
# presumed new.
#
# To simply hash the whole page would get false positives since some comics
# have for example, random-comic links that change on every read, comments
# documenting the number of SQL queries to generate, user forums, constantly
# changing store displays, etc etc etc. Hashing only the <img src= URLs
# eliminated many false positives, but not all.
#
# To eliminate more, we skip src strings that contain substrings from a
# blacklist. This allows skipping certain images that are known from
# experience to change independently from the actual comic. The blacklist
# of bad URLs is maintained in the settings and can be modified by the user.
