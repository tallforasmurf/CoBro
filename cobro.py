CoBro (Comic Browser) is a minimal web browser designed for convenient
reading of Web Comics. The main window has a list of comic names on the left
and a web page display on the right.

Associated with each comic in the list are these persistent items:

  * the user-selected name

  * the user-provided URL of the comic

  * an SHA-1 hash based on the contents of the page at the URL, as it
    was when the comic was last displayed to the user

These items are saved at shutdown and reloaded at startup.

Also associated with each comic but created dynamically as the program runs:

  * the contents of the page at the comic URL

  * an SHA-1 hash based on the contents of the page at the URL, as it
    was read now, since the program started up.

  * a status, one of:

     - comic has not been displayed since it was read (NEWCOMIC)
       i.e., the saved hash is not equal to the new hash.

     - comic has been read and displayed to the user (OLDCOMIC)
       i.e. the saved and latest hash values are the same

     - comic page is being read from its URL (WORKING)

     - error on http request or load, no data (BADCOMIC)

All these data are maintained in memory as a list of Comic objects. The list
is displayed to the user using the Qt model/view classes: The model is the
Python list of Comic objects; a QListView derivative displays the list.

The comic names in the list are shown in different fonts to reflect the
status: normal for been-displayed, bold for not-yet-displayed, italic for
being-read, and strikeout for error.

When the user clicks on a comic in the list, the text of that comic's URL
page is loaded into the web page display with QWebView::setHTML(), where it
is rendered. The displayed page can be used as in any browser, e.g. the user
can click on buttons and follow links in the page. Javascript is allowed
(some comics need it, e.g. the SMBC "red button" does), but java is not.
Browsing is "private," no cookies or caches are kept.

The list supports the following operations:

  * single-click an item to select and display that comic in the web display

  * drag and drop selected items to reorder the list

  * double-click an item to open an Edit Comic dialog which permits
        editing the name and URL.

There is a single menu, the File menu, with these commands:

  * New Comic
        opens a dialog to collect the name and URL of a new comic,
        which is added to the list at the bottom.

  * Refresh
        Apply refresh to the comics selected in the list if any, or to
        all if no selection. The refresh operation is described below.

  * Delete
        After querying for OK, delete the selected comics (if any).

  * Quit
        Save the persistent comic values in QSettings and terminate.

Refresh operation:

When the app loads, or when File>Refresh is chosen, or when the URL of a
comic is edited, the app pushes the model index of all, or selected, or the
edited Comic onto a queue and triggers a QSemaphore. A separate QThread waits
on the semaphore. While there is work on the queue it

* pops the next model index qmi from the queue and:

* signals statusChanged(qmi, WORKING),

* initiates a page-load from the item's URL, saving the text
  in the Comic object,

* if the load ends in error it signals statusChanged(qmi, BADCOMIC)

* else it computes the hash based on the loaded page and saves it
  in the Comic object as new_hash.

* if the new_hash is the same as the saved hash, it signals
  statusChanged(qmi, OLDCOMIC)

* else the new hash is different, the user hasn't seen this comic, so
  it signals statusChanged(qmi, NEWCOMIC)

The statusChanged signal goes to a slot in the list model which updates the
status of the item and calls dataChanged(), with the result that the list view
will call data() for new display data -- resulting in a change of font in
the displayed name of the comic.

In this way, shortly after launching, the user has a list of comics ready
to be read, with the ones yet-unseen in bold.

<p>Single-click a comic name to display its page in this browser.</p>
<p>No comics in the list? Use File&gt;New Comic
to add a comic by name and URL.
Start by adding some of these nerd favorites!
Drag to select one the URLs;
then key ctl-c or right-click to copy (mac: cmd-c or ctl-click);
then select File&gt;New Comic, and fill in its name.</p>

<p>That's enough! There are <i>thousands</i> of web comics out there!
The ones above are of the daily-joke variety, but there are also
richly-drawn graphic novels and everything in between.
For U.S. syndicated (newspaper) cartoons, try
<a href='http://comics.com/'>Comics.com</a> or check the website of your
regional newspaper under "Entertainment". For independent comics, try
<a href='http://thehiveworks.com/'>Hiveworks</a> or <a href='http://new.belfrycomics.net/'>The
Belfry</a> list.</p>
<p>To "refresh" a comic means to read its web page and see if it is
different from the last time. All comics are refreshed when the app starts!</p>
<ul><li>While we are reading its page, a comic's name is <i>italic</i>.</li>
<li>After reading, if the comic looks different from the last time you viewed it,
its name turns <b>bold</b>. (Sometimes this just means a change of
ad copy or user comments.)</li>
<li>If there was a problem reading it, its name is <strike>lined-out</strike>.
Click on it to see the error message.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use File&gt;Refresh to refresh a new or edited comic, or to retry one with an error.
When all refreshes are finished, you can rearrange the list order
by dragging and dropping. Double-click a comic
to edit its name and URL.</p>
<p>While browsing, use ctl-[ for "back" and ctl-] for "forward"
(cmd-[ and cmd-] on a mac). If you right-click on a link (mac: ctl-click),
you get a context menu that you can use to copy the link or open it in
your system default browser.</p>
<p>When you quit the app, it saves the
comic definitions in some magic settings place, depending your OS
(Registry, Library/Preferences, ~/.config).</p>
<p>Use File&gt;Export to write definitions of the selected comics to a UTF-8 text file.
Use File&gt;Import to read definitions from a UTF-8 text file and add them to the list
(or to replace them, when the name's the same). For the import file format,
export one comic and look at that output.</p>
<p>That's it! Enjoy! Oh wait -- read the license!</p>

# This is how we make a hash signature of a comic web page. Instead of

# of the <img statements in it, assuming that these should not change
# from day to day except for the one img that is the day's comic.
#
# This HTML parser subclass is applied to the text of a comic page.
# The handle_starttag method is called for each tag. Only <img start tags
# are looked at, and only the src= attribute, which is pushed into the
# hasher. Thus the hash is built on image urls, skipping certain images
# that are by experience false updates.
#
# To simply hash the whole page gets false positives since some comics have for
# example, random-comic links that change on every read, comments
# documenting the number of SQL queries to generate, user forums,
# constantly changing store displays, etc etc etc. So we parse the
# HTML and hash only the src= attributes of <img /> statements. This

# Implement the concrete list model by subclassing QAbstractListModel
# and gettin' real -- specifically by implementing these abstract methods
# (see qthelp:model-view-programming.html#model-subclassing-reference)
#
# Basic model/view methods:
#
#   rowCount() : return the number of items in the list.
#
#   flags() :
#      for list items return isEnabled | isSelectable | isEditable
#      for list items return isDragEnabled if worker thread is not active
#      for the list as a whole return only isDropEnabled
#
#   data(modelIndex, role) : return values for the display, tooltip,
#      statustip, whatsthis, textalignment, font, and several user roles
#
#   setData(modelIndex, role) : set the data at an index depending on
#      the role and emit the dataChanged signal
#
# Methods used by mainline code to load and save the model (not part of
# the standard model/view paradigm):
#
#   load(settings) : load the comics list from a settings object
#
#   save(settings) : save the comics list into a settings object
#
# Methods required to implement drag/drop reordering:
#
#   insertRows(row, count, parent-index) -- add empty rows
#   removeRows(row, count, parent-index) -- remove rows
#   itemData(modelIndex) -- return all values of a comic as a dict
#   setItemData(modelIndex, dict) -- fill in a comic from a dict of values
#
# Also implemented: a custom Item Delegate to perform editing. Its class
# definition follows ConcreteListModel.
